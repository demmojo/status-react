# Fix permissions in certain directories so that React Native doesn't have a fit
#
# The reasoning for a (mostly) read-only node_modules folder:
#   ideally we’d symlink the folder directly to the Nix store
#   so that we’re guaranteed to have a reproducible source.
#   Unfortunately react-native wants to build some stuff after the fact
#   and this is incompatible with the concept of a pure Nix package.
#   Therefore we copy the whole source to the repo directory,
#   allow writing only on the folders where it is absolutely required,
#   and therefore we still keep some peace of mind that the rest
#   of node_modules is unchanged the rest of the time.
